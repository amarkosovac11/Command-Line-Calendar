## **How to use Command-Line Calendar**
Since this is Command-Line project everything is happening in Terminal. When we run the program, 4 functions show up in the terminal: View Date, Add Event, View Events and Exit.
1.	View Date: This function prompts the user to input a specific year and month, then generates a calendar view for that month. The function prints the month's name and displays a formatted calendar grid showing the days.
2.	Add Event: This function allows users to enter the details for a new event, including the day, month, year and a description. The event is then stored and it is written to local file named "Events.txt," ensuring that the event details are saved for future reference.
3.	View Events: This function displays all events currently stored in the calendar. It checks if there are any events and, if so, it prints each eventâ€™s details. If there are no events, it informs the user that there are no events to display.
4.	Exit: This function allows users to safely exit the program.
